My name is Nate. I have no clue what this blog is gonna be about but maybe one day I'll have like hundred posts and look back and go.... wow. Nate. Did you believe you could do it. Cause I didn't. Proud of you kid. Hope the time you spent writing and dealing with technical problems on a static site was well worth it. Love you boo. Okay bye.
