For one week I secretly tracked my co-worker's coffee habits because I saw this post on Reddit and was like, damn; Colin drinks a lot of coffee. I should track this. What type of person drinks this much coffee? Well, Colin is a Reports developer that spends a lot of time looking at SQL. So really his consumption of coffee makes a little bit of sense.  

Over the course of a ~40 hour work week Colin has consumed 28 cups of coffee. Or 5.6 cups of coffee every day. That's roughly a cup of coffee every ~1.5 hours. I would say most of the time Colin is drinking this [brand of coffee](https://www.amazon.com/San-Francisco-Bay-Coffee-Compatible/dp/B007Y59HVM?th=1). It's $30 for 80 count. So Colin is really only costing the company like $10/week in coffee. If anything, this is just incredibly cost effective for Colin. It's like he graduated from the school of thievery and he's riding the profits of free coffee. 

I couldn't track down the exact amount, but the [company's wiki](https://sfbaycoffee.com/pages/nutrition-information#:~:text=How%20much%20caffeine%20is%20in,90%2D150%20mg%20of%20caffeine.) says most their products stay within 90-150mg of caffeine per 8oz cup. So Colin is consuming ~670 mg of caffeine a day.

I asked Colin if he thought about cutting back and he's told me he already has. He's afraid if he cuts back any more he'll start to get the shakes and jitters again, like the last time he cut back. I think Colin is addicted to caffeine. 

Moral of the story, I moved to drinking decaf tea now. Earl Grey ain't half bad.
