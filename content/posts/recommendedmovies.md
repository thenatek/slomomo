Movies are great. Here's some you should watch. 
I'll give ya a pitch too. 

### Turbo Kid 
Alright, so Turbo Kid. Do yourself the favor and skip the trailer. Skip the short. Just watch this movie. It's not like amazingly put together. It's a love child to Mad Max and The Wizard. That's all you need to know about it. Watch it please and love Apple.

## Dope
This movie has one of the best first acts I've seen in a long time. The second act to third act stand on their own, but not as well. Skip the final 2 minutes of the movie if you don't feel like having a bad taste in your mouth. The soundrack, no pun intended. Was dope. 

## The Way Way Back
Sam Rockwell. Well I suppose Steve Carell as well. But Sam Rockwell. Just watch it. It's a good feel-good movie. The best part of this movie is the believable character Rockwell portrays. To be honest, I think he wasn't really acting. Just chilling on set for a couple weeks. 

## Paper Towns
You remember growing up and having that crush. That dream. The desire to have more in life come to you. This movie handles that effortlessly while giving you the reality check most of us need. 

## The Martian
First, go listen to the audio book. It's done well. Second, watch this movie and be amazed at how dang close the mediums are. Outside of skipping a few scenes, this is the truest I ever seen a movie reach to it's source. Matt Damon is worth rescuing in this one. 

## Lilo and Stitch
Stitch is the perfect dog.

## Deadpool
You remember when they "leaked" the test footage to get this movie made. Yeah, so do I. The fact this movie even exists warrants to be listed here. It's compact of a story and enjoyable. 

## Spirited Away
Spirited Away was the first Studio Ghibli I had ever seen. The art is lovely and that characters are adorable. Morality is mixed as even the villains of the movie don't seem all that bad. 

## Safety Not Guaranteed
If I told you I could travel back in time, would you follow me? 

## Me and Early and the Dying Girl
Some of the most unique camera angles I have ever seen in a movie. This movie is beautiful. Lots of quick cuts and whips and pans, tilts, and VERY transparent complex camera shots and moves. As the film goes on, the short edits disappear, and the long shots become more static. The film grows up with the characters.

## Mad Max: Fury Road
The opposite of Waterworld. 

## The Kings of Summer
Watch this movie when you need to remember your adventures. 

## How to Train your Dragon
Never trust a Dragon. Sometimes you'll fall in love with them. 

## The Spectacular Now
Sometime's being a family is hard. Make your own. 

## The Perks of Being a Wallflower
You've already read the book. Watch the movie. 

## Big Hero 6
I have a tattoo of Baymax. 

## Interstellar
I've seen this movie once. 70mm. The experience was surreal. For that reason I've avoided a second watch. But the experience of this movie is the closest I have been since watching Avatar for the first time. 

## The Blues Brothers
There's 106 miles to Chicago, we've got a full tank of gas, half a pack of cigarettes, it's dark out, and we're wearing sunglasses.

## Akira
Destruction is real. It's dangerous. And it can be caused by any person you meet throughout your day. Don't take for granted what life has provided you. 

## Chronicle
The best Superhero movie. 

## Finding Nemo
Fishy fishy. 

## Wolf of Wall Street
This movie feels like you are snorting cocaine into the asshole of a prostitute.

## The Lego Movie
EVERYTHING IS AWESOME.

## The Lion King
A very important movie to my childhood. You know this movie. Give it a re-watch sometime. 

## We Are Your Friends
Reality is, some people you know are assholes. 

## A Knight's Tale
I was able to meet someone amazing because of this movie. <3

## Krampus
I love practical effects. The Thing if The Thing was a dark-comedy. Honestly. 

## The Thing
Re-watching this movie I forget how gross parts of it are. I'll warn you on that, but the practical effects hold to today. Watch this please if you are wanting a great Horror movie. 

## Swiss Army Man
Penis Compass. 

## Prisoners
Emotions outweigh Logic. 

## Tron: Legacy
I am hoping having this movie here will somehow lead to a sequel finally getting made. It's deserved. 

## Insidious
The best modern horror that exists. The sequel as a follow up is the most satisfying wrap up.
